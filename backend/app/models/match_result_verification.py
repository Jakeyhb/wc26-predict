"""MatchResultVerification — audit trail of source claims about match scores.

Each row is either:
- A single source claim: "AFA says score is 3-0, match is FT"
- A consensus row: "2+ sources agree the score is 3-0"

Consensus rows have is_consensus=True. Source rows that contributed to a
consensus have their consensus_for_id pointing to the consensus row.

This is NOT a replacement for MatchResult — it is an audit trail that
verifies whether the score in match_results is trustworthy before it
enters the learning pipeline.
