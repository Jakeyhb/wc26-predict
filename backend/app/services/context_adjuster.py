"""ContextAdjuster — applies context-based adjustments from learned history.

Reads context_performance_matrix to find systematic biases for
specific match contexts (derby, must_win, relegation_battle, etc.)
and applies micro-corrections to the fused probabilities.

Adjustments are very small (max ±3pp) and only activate when
≥10 matches of data exist for that context.
