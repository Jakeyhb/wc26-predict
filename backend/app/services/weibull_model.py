"""Bivariate Weibull Count Model via penaltyblog.

The Weibull model assumes goal inter-arrival times follow a Weibull
distribution (not exponential/Poisson), capturing momentum effects.
A Frank Copula introduces inter-team correlation, making it better
than independent Poisson for over/under 2.5 goal predictions.

Reference: Boshnakov, Kharrat & McHale (2017).

Integration: Optional complement to Dixon-Coles, weighted ~15% in UCL scenes.
