"""Group Standings Service — real-time World Cup group table calculation.

Computes group standings from wc26_schedule match results, ranks teams
within groups, and calculates third-place qualification ranking.

Design principles:
- Pure functions: no DB writes, only reads from wc26_schedule
- Deterministic tie-breaking matches FIFA 2026 rules
- Used by Match Importance calculator for EI scoring
