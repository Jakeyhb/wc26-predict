"""SignalAdjusterSync — lightweight synchronous signal adjustment for artifact pipeline.

Unlike the async SignalAdjuster (which requires DB for dynamic multipliers and
rebuilds xG matrices), this version applies simple probability-level adjustments
based on approved signals. Designed for the sync prediction_core.py pipeline.

Usage:
    from app.services.signal_adjuster_sync import apply_signal_adjustments

    home_prob, draw_prob, away_prob, risk_tags = apply_signal_adjustments(
        home_prob=0.45, draw_prob=0.25, away_prob=0.30,
        home_team="China PR", away_team="Thailand",
