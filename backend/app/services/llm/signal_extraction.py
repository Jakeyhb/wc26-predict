1. Only extract signals with clear, verifiable evidence in the article text.

3. signal_type must be one of: injury, suspension, lineup, rotation, motivation, weather, travel, coach, morale, other
4. confidence: 0.0-1.0. Use 0.7+ for official announcements, 0.5-0.7 for credible reports, <0.5 for rumors.
5. If no relevant football intelligence is found, return {"has_signals": false}
